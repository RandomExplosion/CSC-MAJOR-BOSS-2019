<H2> The Small Things Become Big Things</h2>
<br>
<p> When you move about your life, it's innevitable <br>
that you won't be able to water your plants.
Amongst the common problems of life; work, food, bills, <br>
watering the plants seems small. However, it all adds <br>
up. </p>

<h2> The Small Things Become Nonexistent Things </h2>
<br>
<p> Trying to make the small problems small again with <br>
schedules and plans is just making them big things. <br>
What you really need is somebody to just do what you <br>
can't do.</p>

<h1> Robots now water your plants! </h1>
