<p> When you move about your life, it's innevitable <br>
that you won't be able to water your plants.
Amongst the common problems of life; work, food, bills, <br>
watering the plants seems small. However, it all adds <br>
up. </p>

schedules and plans is just making them big things. <br>

can't do.</p>
